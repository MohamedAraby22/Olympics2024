# Olympic Data Analysis Project (2024)
This project explores the 2024 Olympic Games data using Python for data retrieval and Power BI for interactive visualization.

## Project Overview
The goal is to gain valuable insights into athlete performance, country rankings, and overall event dynamics.
We achieve this by leveraging the power of Python for data manipulation and Power BI for creating compelling visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: Used for data retrieval, cleaning, and preparation.
Power BI: Used for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
Kaggle API: Used to download the Olympic Games dataset (if applicable).

## Project Steps
* 1. Setting Up Your Environment (Python, Kaggle API)

Python: Install required libraries (pandas, os, kaggle). Ensure you have a development environment set up.


Kaggle API: Create a Kaggle account and obtain your API token (if you plan to download data from Kaggle).

* 2. Python Script for Downloading the Dataset 

This step is necessary if you plan to download data from Kaggle. You can skip this step if you have the dataset available elsewhere.

Create a Python script to download the Olympic Games dataset using the Kaggle API 

* 3. Importing Data into Power BI using Python Script 

This step is helpful if you want to automate data import into Power BI.

Create a Power BI dataset and connect it to your Python script.

Use Python code to import the downloaded dataset into Power BI.

* 4. Data Preparation and Analysis in Power BI

Clean and preprocess the data in Power BI to ensure data quality and consistency.

Create DAX measures to calculate relevant metrics (medal counts, athlete performance, country rankings).

Utilize calculated columns or tables for derived data.

* 5. Creating Visualizations in Power BI

Develop informative and visually appealing visualizations to communicate your findings.

Use charts, graphs, and tables to represent key trends and patterns.

Customize visualizations to match your project's specific requirements.
